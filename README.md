# Description

- Learning Ray Tracing from scratch using compute shaders in Unity. Thanks to [David Kuri](https://twitter.com/davidjkuri) for his [awesome tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20230929075915/http://three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/) and [code](https://bitbucket.org/Daerst/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity/src/Tutorial_Pt1/).

- This project implements a GPU-accelerated Whitted-style ray tracer capable of rendering scenes that include planes and numerous spheres, featuring mirror-like reflections, basic diffuse lighting, and sharp shadows.

- Here is a [demo video](https://youtu.be/Ldk_A19vR78) running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU.
