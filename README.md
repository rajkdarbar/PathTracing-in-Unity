# Description

- The goal here is to understand the fundamentals of Path Tracing using Unity's compute shaders. Special shoutout to [David Kuri](https://twitter.com/davidjkuri) for his incredible [tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20230926231248/http://three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/12/gpu-path-tracing-in-unity-part-2/) and [code](https://bitbucket.org/Daerst/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity/src/Tutorial_Pt2/).

- This project features a GPU-accelerated path tracer designed to render scenes with planes and multiple spheres. It supports diffuse global illumination, glossy reflections, and soft shadows.

- Check out this demo video, showcasing the project on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU.
